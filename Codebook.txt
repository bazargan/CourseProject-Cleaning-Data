======================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
======================================

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- A 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
======================================

The set of 79-features is a subset of the original feature with 561 variables that were listed in the "features.txt" file of the 
original data, and can be found at the following link with information about variables in the accompanied "features_info.txt" : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
These 79 features are extracted from the variables in the original list that are representing either "mean", i.e. average, or "std", i.e. standard deviation, of a variable.
These "mean" or "std" variables are then averaged over each subject and each activity, and hence the names of these variables have changed to include the "Average-" at the beginning of the variable names.
In other words, the values of these variables in the final TidyDataset is the average of that variable over the instances of that variable for the given "Subject" and "Activity".

Here is the list of these variable names shown as column labels in the TidyDataset.txt:

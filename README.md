# CourseProject-Cleaning-Data

### The run_analysis.R is an R script that processes the data and creates a tidy data set based on the data provided in the course project assignment. 
###  This data is collected from the accelerometer sensors from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
###  Original data and its full description is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

### For proper execution of this script, it is assumed that the working directory is set
###  to the folder that contains the uncompressed content of the data provided in 
###  the project webpage, i.e. working directory contains the unzipped "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
###  This method was chosen as it speeds up the run time of the script.
